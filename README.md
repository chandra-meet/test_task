# test_task
here is the example task of to do list using Mvvm clean architecture
The goal of this project is to provide a quick overview about how we are creating UI and
reusing so much easy. In this demo I used some of hand-picked collection of Android libraries,
tools, open-source projects- like google material etc.

This project will try to **showcase only the best, most popular and well-tested resources** that you
will actually need and find useful rather than overwhelming you with a plethora of low-quality ones.

I created 2 screen where one will use to showcase the to-do list, one for add item in to-do list and one alert dialog as well.

Happy Coding. :+1:
